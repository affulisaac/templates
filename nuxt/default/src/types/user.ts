// The files in this directory are used to generate the types for the application. 
// The file name should correspond to the type that is being defined. 
// Example, user.ts should define the User type.

// The types should be exported as a named export and used in other parts of the application.

// export type User = {
//     id: string,
//     email: string,
//     firstName: string,  
//     lastName: string,
//     role: string,
//     ...
// }
